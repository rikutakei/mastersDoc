% List of things to discuss

% RESULTS 1

% Creighton metagene section
% Lack of association of obesity metagenes with different cancer data sets
% -- due to metagene derivation from a specific data and therefore cannot be applied to other data set
% -- don't forget about the possibility of having samples that may not be driven by obesity at all in the data set (and therefore the metagene may be affected by these samples).

% FM metagene section
% -- don't forget about the possibility of having samples that may not be driven by obesity at all in the data set (and therefore the metagene may be affected by these samples).
