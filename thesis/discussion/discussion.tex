\section{something}

% List of things to discuss

% RESULTS 1

% Creighton metagene section
% Lack of association of obesity metagenes with different cancer data sets
% -- due to metagene derivation from a specific data and therefore cannot be applied to other data set
% -- don't forget about the possibility of having samples that may not be driven by obesity at all in the data set (and therefore the metagene may be affected by these samples).

% FM metagene section
% -- don't forget about the possibility of having samples that may not be driven by obesity at all in the data set (and therefore the metagene may be affected by these samples).

% gene expression section
% -- mention that Creighton's group probably didn't control for FDR


% RESULTS 2

% Pathway associated genetic signature directions

% Pathway and obesity associated genetic signatures
% -- some metagenes had consistently high correlation across different data sets.
%		-- showed that these signatures were more reliable than the others
%		-- the qualities of these signatures were good as they showed similar metagene scores across different data sets
%			-- quality of the signatures may be due to the difference in experimental conditions, or the samples used by Gatza et al...?

% -- FM metagene not clustering with AKT
%		-- due to shitty akt pathway signature, or difference in mouse model.
