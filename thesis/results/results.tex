\chapter{Obesity-associated genetic signatures and cancer}
\label{cha:obesity_genetic_signatures_and_cancer}

In this chapter, the relationship between the obesity-associated genetic signatures from previous studies and different cancer types were investigated; new obesity-associated genetic signatures were identified in the data set from \citet{Creighton2012} study; and the presence of common genes or pathways across different cancer types was examined.
